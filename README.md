## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (preferred package manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository

## 🌳 Branch Structure

The project uses the following branch structure:

- `main` - Production branch, contains stable code
- `develop` - Development branch, contains latest features
- `feature/[feature-name]` - For new features (e.g., `feature/task-management`)
- `bugfix/[bug-name]` - For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/login-issue`)
- `hotfix/[fix-name]` - For urgent production fixes

To start working on a new feature:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

For bug fixes:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b bugfix/bug-description
```
